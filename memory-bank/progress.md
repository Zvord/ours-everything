# Progress: Russian Noun Cases Drill

## What Works
- The application has been implemented with three distinct drill types: Forward Drill, Backward Drill, and Insert Drill.
- Core components are functional, including the Flask app, routes, models, utilities, and Jinja2 templates.
- The user interface supports bilingual (English/Russian) functionality.
- Data is loaded from JSON files for nouns and sentences.
- The Memory Bank has been initialized with the following files:
  - projectbrief.md (existing)
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - activeContext.md

## What's Left to Build
- Expand the noun and sentence databases to include more varied and comprehensive examples.
- Enhance user experience with additional feedback, progress tracking, and scoring mechanisms.
- Optimize performance and prepare for future feature enhancements (e.g., user accounts, additional drill types).

## Current Status
- The application runs locally on port 5001 in debug mode.
- The current implementation provides a functional practice environment for Russian noun declensions.
- All core features are operational as per the initial project scope.

## Known Issues
- Limited data in JSON files may restrict diversity in practice.
- Feedback is currently basic (correct/incorrect) without detailed grammatical explanations.
- Persistent user data storage is not implemented.

## Next Steps
- Increase the dataset in `data/nouns.json` and `data/sentences.json`.
- Refine drill logic and UI based on user testing and feedback.
- Plan and implement additional features as described in the active context.
