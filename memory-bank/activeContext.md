# Active Context: Russian Noun Cases Drill

## Current Work Focus
The Russian Noun Cases Drill application is currently in a functional state with three distinct drill types implemented:
1. Forward Drill (noun → case/number)
2. Backward Drill (inflected form → case/number identification)
3. Insert Drill (contextual sentence completion)

The application provides a bilingual interface (English/Russian) and supports practice across all six Russian grammatical cases and both singular and plural number forms.

## Recent Changes
- Initial implementation of the three drill types
- Bilingual UI support with language switching
- Responsive design for various device sizes
- JSON-based data storage for nouns and sentences

## Next Steps
Potential enhancements to consider:

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Expand Word Database**
   - Add more nouns to `data/nouns.json` for greater variety
   - Include nouns with different declension patterns (e.g., irregular forms)

2. **Enhance Sentence Database**
   - Add more sentences to `data/sentences.json` for each case
   - Ensure coverage of different usage patterns for each case

3. **User Experience Refinements**
   - Add progress tracking within a session
   - Implement a scoring system
   - Provide more detailed feedback on errors

### Medium-term Features
1. **User Accounts**
   - Allow users to create accounts to track progress
   - Implement spaced repetition for personalized practice

2. **Additional Drill Types**
   - Add drills for adjective-noun agreement
   - Implement preposition + case drills
   - Create listening comprehension exercises

3. **Performance Analytics**
   - Track user performance by case and number
   - Identify patterns in errors
   - Suggest focused practice areas

### Long-term Vision
1. **Comprehensive Russian Grammar Platform**
   - Expand beyond noun cases to other grammar aspects
   - Include verb conjugation, aspect, and motion verbs
   - Add adjective and pronoun declension

2. **Content Integration**
   - Incorporate authentic reading materials
   - Add audio pronunciation
   - Include cultural context for language usage

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
1. **Data Expansion Strategy**
   - Continue with JSON files for now due to simplicity
   - Consider SQLite or another lightweight database if data grows significantly
   - Maintain separation of data from application logic

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor PyMorphy3 performance with larger datasets
   - Consider caching common inflections if performance becomes an issue

3. **Code Organization**
   - Maintain the current separation of concerns
   - Consider breaking down `routes.py` into separate modules if additional features are added

### UX Considerations
1. **Feedback Mechanisms**
   - Enhance error feedback to be more instructive
   - Consider adding explanations for why certain forms are correct

2. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards
   - Improve keyboard navigation
   - Add ARIA attributes where appropriate

3. **Mobile Experience**
   - Further optimize the mobile interface
   - Consider touch-specific interactions for mobile users

### Content Strategy
1. **Word Selection**
   - Focus on high-frequency vocabulary
   - Group words by difficulty level
   - Include words that demonstrate different declension patterns

2. **Sentence Complexity**
   - Gradually increase sentence complexity
   - Ensure grammatical structures are appropriate for learner levels
   - Include cultural context where relevant

## Current Challenges
1. **Limited Data**
   - The current noun and sentence databases are minimal
   - Need for more diverse examples covering different declension patterns

2. **Basic Feedback**
   - Current feedback is limited to correct/incorrect
   - No explanation of grammatical rules or patterns

3. **No Progress Tracking**
   - Users cannot track their progress over time
   - No personalization based on user performance

4. **Limited Exercise Types**
   - Current drills focus only on isolated aspects of noun declension
   - Need for more integrated practice with real-world usage
