# Product Context: Russian Noun Cases Drill

## Purpose
The Russian Noun Cases Drill application exists to help language learners practice and master Russian noun declensions, which is one of the most challenging aspects of learning the Russian language. The application provides an interactive, focused environment for users to practice different grammatical cases and number forms of Russian nouns.

## Problems Solved
1. **Complexity of Russian Grammar**: Russian has six grammatical cases and two number forms, creating numerous inflection patterns that are difficult to memorize and apply correctly.
2. **Limited Practice Resources**: Traditional textbooks offer limited interactive practice for noun declensions.
3. **Feedback Gap**: Language learners often lack immediate feedback on their grammatical accuracy.
4. **Targeted Practice Need**: Learners need to focus on specific cases or forms that give them trouble.

## How It Works
The application offers three distinct drill types to address different learning needs:

1. **Forward Drill**:
   - Presents a noun in its nominative (dictionary) form
   - Asks the user to provide the correct inflected form based on a specified case and number
   - Validates the answer and provides immediate feedback
   - Allows users to select which cases and number forms they want to practice

2. **Backward Drill**:
   - Shows an already inflected noun
   - Challenges the user to identify the correct grammatical case and number
   - Tests recognition and analytical skills rather than production

3. **Insert Drill**:
   - Presents a complete sentence with a missing word
   - Provides the base form (lemma) of the missing word as a hint
   - Requires the user to determine the correct inflected form based on context
   - Groups sentences by case to focus practice on specific grammatical patterns

## User Experience Goals
1. **Bilingual Interface**: Support for both English and Russian UI to accommodate different learner preferences and proficiency levels.
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Clear indication of correct/incorrect answers with the correct solution provided when mistakes occur.
3. **Focused Practice**: Allow users to select specific cases and number forms to practice based on their learning needs.
4. **Progressive Learning**: Enable users to practice one concept at a time through different exercise types.
5. **Clean, Distraction-Free UI**: Simple, intuitive interface that focuses on the learning task without unnecessary complexity.
6. **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Responsive layout that works well on various devices to enable practice anywhere.
